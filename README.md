# Box Office Automation

This is a simple yet functional cinema box office automation program created using C#, MySQL, and Krypton UI. It was created for a visual programming tutorial and not designed for commercial use. However, you can use it as you wish.

This is the first time I've used a UI framework in a C# WinForm application. I originally intended to start this project a day ago, but choosing a framework turned out to be much harder than I initially thought. However, I've been working on it for approximately 12 hours now, and I'm really close to finishing it. Although I intended to use the Krypton UI framework, I found that it wasn't making things easier, so I ended up using the default WinForm UI for everything except some buttons and combo boxes. I hope you like the design and colors.

By the way, the project isn't yet completed. I'm currently working on it and expect to finish it on April 6th, 2023. However, I may update it from time to time for fun and to improve my skills.
